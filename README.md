# Regex Tutorial - Matching an Email

This is a tutorial on how to use a Regular Expression (regex). They can be used to pull out information from a body of code. The Match Email regex can help with validating emails while using technologies such as Node. This tutorial will break down the components of the regex. Below, the table of contents can be used to quickly move to the topic the reader chooses.

## Summary

The following code snippet is used to match an email:

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

The above regex is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. A regex can be used to validate input or find/replace characters within a string. This particular regex can be used to validate that emails are following the correct format.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors can help mark the beginning and end of a regex. Instead of being used to match any characters, they are instead used to match a position before or after characters.

`^` - This anchor matches the beginning of a string or line

`$` - This anchor matches the end of a string or line
